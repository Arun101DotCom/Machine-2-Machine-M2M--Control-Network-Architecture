# Machine-2-Machine-M2M--Control-Network-Architecture
Implementation of a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) framework using Raspberry Pis and the OSI model. Features a multi-homed network architecture with custom routing and packet analysis (tcpdump). Includes a closed-loop DC motor control system using PID algorithms to mitigate network latency and stabilize real-time hardware performance.
